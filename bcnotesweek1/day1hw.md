# How to deal with frustrations

It is very common for me to get stuck on something and not want to quit until it
is finished.
I need to set rules to make sure I deal with those frustrations.
A list of things I can do to ensure that I deal with them in a 
healthy way. 

If I feel stuck on an issue I need to first:

- **Stop and breathe**
- **Cook/eat some food**
- **Walk around the house**
- **Go for a quick jog on the treadmill**
  
If I continue to struggle take more steps:

- **Take a break and walk my dog**
- **Don't be afraid to ask for help**
