# Branching

- Used to me called master, is now called main.

## Branches
- A branch is a sandbox cloistered off because it isn't ready
to be merged into the main line of development yet.
  
- Head is git's term for the commit that git is looking at right now. Head is the most recent commit on the branch you're looking at.

- git checkout -b foo - create a new branch called foo. 

- git checkout foo (do this to change branches)

- git branch -d foo Delete branch

- git branch -m foo rename branch

- git merge foo merges branch foo into the current branch

## Basic principles

- Don't develop on the main branch. Ever. Instead, merge other branches into it when they're production ready. 
- There's a develop branch that serves as the basis for almost all new code.
- New code should  be developed on feature branches that are branched off from development.
- Feature branches should be small and self-contained. One per ticket.
